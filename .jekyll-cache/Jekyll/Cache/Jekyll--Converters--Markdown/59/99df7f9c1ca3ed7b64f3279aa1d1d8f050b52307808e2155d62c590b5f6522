I"Å<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>This website is to keep track of my progress preparing for the OSCP. Right now I only work part-time teaching kids how to program, but I‚Äôm hoping to move into offensive security in the near future.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm active on Hack the Box as well as Try Hack Me, and I‚Äôll be posting about whatever it is I‚Äôm studying for the week as well. My badges for each site will be posted below.
