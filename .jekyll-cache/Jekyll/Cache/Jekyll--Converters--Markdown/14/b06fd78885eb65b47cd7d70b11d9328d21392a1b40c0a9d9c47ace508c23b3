<p>This is an easy box on TryHackMe that came out not that long ago. I haven’t done many ctfs recently (new job, crazy hours), and I just needed to get back into the swing of things. This box looked like the perfect place to start. I’m probably

<p>I scanned this box with <a href="https://github.com/dievus/threader3000">threader3000</a> which is a multi-threaded port scanner that can save a ton of time on boxes where you suspect there’s a higher port open. It can also run an nmap scan after finding the open ports. Here’s the output from the nmap scan:

<p>As you can see we have ports 21(ftp), 22(ssh), and 80(http) open. ftp is allowing anonymous login, which is always great for hackers.
<br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="ftp-enumeration">ftp enumeration</h2>

<p>Investigating the ftp service on port 21 (you can do this with the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ftp STARTUP-IP</code> and then using the user name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">anonymous</code> and leaving a blank password when prompted) gives us a couple of files that we can pull from the service with ‘get FILE_NAME’.
<br />
<br /></p>

<p><img src="assets/images/startup/startup_ftp.png" alt="" />
<br />
<br /></p>

<p>There’s a file called notice.txt that contains the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Whoever is leaving these damn Among Us memes in this share, it IS NOT FUNNY.
People downloading documents from our website will think we are a joke! Now I
dont know who it is, but Maya is looking pretty sus.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>hmmm, there is the possible username <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Maya</code>, but it also mentions people downloading documents thinking the company is a joke, did they link the ftp fileshare to their website?
<br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="web-enumeration">web enumeration</h2>

<p>The webpage states it’s under development. The source code doesn’t give us any extra info either.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/startup/startup_webpage.png" alt="" />
<br />
<br /></p>

<p>The next step is to run a gobuster scan to see if there’s any interesting directories on the website. The result of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gobuster</code> scan is only one directory:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/files (Status: 301)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>navigating to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/files</code> directory gives us the follwing page:</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/startup/startup_files.png" alt="" />
<br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="initial-access">initial access</h2>

<p>They did indeed link the ftp file share to the webpage. If we can upload a file to the ftp directory, we can try and get a reverse shell. I’ll use the standard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">php-reverse-shell.php</code> file that comes with both kali and parrotOS. We’ll need to change the IP and port in that file to that of our attacking machine. After that, we can set up a listener on our attacking machine and access the file through our browser to activate the malicious php script on our victim machine.</p>

<p>After changing the IP and port in the php script, we can navigate back to the ftp directory through the fileshare on the command line. We can upload the php reverse shell with the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">put php-reverse-shell.php</code> and we should get a message indicating the file uploaded properly.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/startup/startup_shell.png" alt="" />
<br />
<br /></p>

<p>Once we’ve got this shell uploaded, we need to setup a netcat listener on our attacking machine with the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nc -lvnp REV-SHELL-PORT</code>. From there, it’s as simple as navigating back to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">files</code> in our browser and clicking on our file.
<br />
<br /></p>

<p><img src="assets/images/startup/startup_ftpfile.png" alt="" />
<br />
<br /></p>

<p><img src="assets/images/startup/startup_initial.png" alt="" />
<br />
<br /></p>

<p>As you can see, this gives us an initial shell as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www-data</code>. We can’t access the user flag, but there is a user named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lennie</code> that we can try and move to.
<br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="user-privilege-escalation">user privilege escalation</h2>

<p>Before I get into the user priv esc, I’d like to mention a really simple toolset that I use to stabilize my shells. It’s John Hammond’s <a href="https://github.com/JohnHammond/poor-mans-pentest">poor-mans-pentest</a>. This toolset is very basic stuff, but worth at least a quick look. He and another ctf player, Caleb Stewart, have started development on a toolset called <a href="https://github.com/JohnHammond/poor-mans-pentest">pwncat</a>. I haven’t had the time to look at it, but I’ve seen a video of some of the functionality and it looks really impressive. Anyway, back to the box.</p>

<p>Poking around the file system, we see some irregularities in the root directory. There’s a few directories that don’t belong, but the most interesting is the one named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">incidents</code>. Inside there’s a wireshark file that we can download onto our machine by spinning up a web server on our victim and using wget. Here’s the commands in action:</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/startup/startup_download.png" alt="" />
<br />
<br /></p>

<p>You can see that the top section is the web server, and that I misspelled the file the first time I tried downloading it… But that I did grab the file eventually.</p>

<p>Now we can investigate the wireshark file on our attacking machine. Firing it up we get a flood of network activity. This part would have stumped me if not for the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/overpass2hacked">overpass2</a> room. This room taught me how to do some basic wireshark navigation and what to look for. Perhaps the quickest way to find what we’re looking for is to find a packet that looks like reverse shell commands (reverse shells send data in cleartext), right click on it, and select the Follow -&gt; TCP stream option. This gives us a nice view of what commands were being sent to the reverse shell.</p>
