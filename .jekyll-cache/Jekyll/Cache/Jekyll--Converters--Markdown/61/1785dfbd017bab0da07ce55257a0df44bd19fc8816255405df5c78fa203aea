I"w<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>This website is to keep track of my progress preparing for the OSCP. Right now I only work part-time teaching kids how to program, but I’m hoping to move into offensive security in the near future.</p>

<p>I’m active on Hack the Box as well as Try Hack Me, and I’ll be posting about whatever it is I’m studying for the week as well.</p>
