# TryHackMe - Overpass2
___________________________

This room is more a forensics room. The story is that someone has hacked the overpass website and we need to investigate how the attacker got in, what they did, and how we can get back on the box. We'll be using wireshark and some OSINT to figure out how the attacker got on and we'll see if we can't get back on the box. BTW, there is a walkthrough vide of this room by John Hammond, he's an excellent cyber-security resource on youtube so check him out if that's your thing.

## analyse the PCAP

The first section of this room is to analyse the wireshark packet capture file and see what the attacker did. We'll figure out where they uploaded, what they uploaded, and all the commands that the attacker used on the box. The first place to start with the packet capture file is `http POST` requests. Naviagting the file in wireshark and searching for `http`, we can see a `POST` request made to the `/development/` directory. This is a good place to look. If we inspect the request we can also see the reverse shell that got uploaded.

You can see the php code that gave the attacker the reverse shell. Now that we know the packet where the attacker uploaded his shell, we can simply inspect the packets beneath that until we see some shell commands. Netcat reverse shells transmit in clear text. The first command we see is to stabilize the shell. Once we locate that packet we can get a good overview of what the attacker did by going to analyze -> follow -> tcp stream. This allows us to see exactly what commands the attacker used.

The attacker grabbed the user `james` password and switched to that user. From there, they dumped the `/etc/shadow` file. The room would like for us to take the shadow file and see how many of the passwords are crackable with the `fasttrack.txt` wordlist. You can use `hashcat` or `john` for this. If you use `john`, this is what I used:
<br>
<br>

`sudo john hashes.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt`
<br>
<br>

The last part of this analysis is the program that the attacker used to install a backdoor on the machine. We can see that they cloned a git repo named `ssh-backdoor`. The next section is all about figuring out what the backdoor does.

## analysis of the backdoor  

Going to the git repo with the backdoor script [here](https://github.com/NinjaJc01/ssh-backdoor), we see only a couple of scripts, but the main one is, aptly named `main.go`. We can see that there's a default hash and a hardcoded salt involved in the code, but the attacker actually used their own hash. We can investigate the PCAP file again to see what the attacker used as their hash. So, with the hash and the salt, we can construct a hash that can be cracked. For this one, I used hashcat. The basic construction of the hash is `hash:salt`. I saved the hash in a file named `attacker_hash`, and the command I used is:
<br>
<br>

`hashcat -m 1710 attacker_hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
<br>
<br>

## back to the machine

Once we get that password cracked, we can connect to the victim machine through the backdoor the attacker installed. Once on the machine, we can grab the user flag with ease.

## root escalation

The escalation here is easy. The attacker left a quick way to escalate. After trying to run `sudo -l` with `james` password and failing, I took a look at the files in the home folder for `james` and saw a `.suid_bash` file owned by root. We can run this file with the `-p` argument to keep the permissions of the file owner and that allows us to get a shell as root.

From there root is only a `cat` command away. This was a great box that gave me a chance to refresh myself on wireshark and researching some code. Thanks for reading if you've gotten this far, and a special thanks to the creator of this box!
