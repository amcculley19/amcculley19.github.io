# TryHackMe - Game Zone  
___________________________
This room continues on the offensive security path on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/gamezone). This room focuses on SQL injection and uses SQLmap as the main tool. Let's get started.

## nmap Scan

We'll start this off by making some directories and running some scans.
<br>
<br>

```

We've got port 22 and port 80 open. Let's take a look at port 80 first considering we've got no info for an attack on port 22.

## Web Enumeration  

Taking a look at the home page gives us the answer to one of the questions posed in task 1. The character holding the sniper is from the game hitman and his name is `Agent 47`.

The room wastes no time telling us that we're going to use SQL injection to get our enumeration. The room does a good job of telling us what SQL is, and how it works. SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is used for adding, modifying or retrieving data from databases. As an attacker, any place where a user is allowed to enter input can be considered a potential attack vector. This room is no different. In addition to letting us know where the attack vector is, the room also lets us know what query the login info is entered into:  

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username AND password := password`

This kind of information is invaluable. After a brief example of theoretical SQLi. It tells us to enter the username and password fields as `' or 1=1 -- -`. This tricks the database into giving us access to the `portal.php` page. The next task has us using a  well-known tool called `SQLMap`. The first step is to use `BurpSuite` to intercept the POST request to the search feature of the website. Next we copy the request to a file and save it in order to run it through `SQLMap`. Below is a picture of the http request, followed by the `SQLMap` command that I ran.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

`sqlmap -r gamezone_request.txt --dbms=mysql --dump`  

The `gamezone_request.txt` file is what I called the copied http request file.

## Hash Cracking with Hashcat

The goal now is to crack the password hash for the `agent47` user. Although the room walks us through `JohnTheRipper`, we'll use `Hashcat` instead. The syntax is basically similar, but here's the full hashcat command:
<br>
<br>

`hashcat -m 1400 hash1.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
<br>
<br>

![](assets/images/gamezone/gamezone_pass.png)
<br>
<br>

The `-m 1400` allows hashcat know what kind of hash it is.

## Foothold and User Flag  

Now we can ssh using the the `agent47` user and the cracked password hash.
<br>

## Reverse SSH Tunneling  

The next part of the room deals with reverse SSH tunneling. SSH tunneling allows us as attackers to forward services to us bypassing any firewall restrictions. The room tells us to run `ss -tulpn` to see all the socket connections running on the machine. With the output of the command we can see a connection on port 10000. We can forward the service running on that port to our local machine by using the command:  

`ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 agent47@<ip-address>`
<br>
<br>

Now we can access the CMS running on the remote server on our local machine.  typing in `localhost:10000` gives us access to the `webmin` CMS. We can try the creds that we discovered earlier.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

They worked! And now we can see what version of webmin is running, which is `webmin 1.580`. The room now wants us to use metasploit to grab the `root.txt` flag.

## Privilege Escalation  

Opening up metasploit and typing in `search webmin 1.580` gives us a module `unix/webapp/webmin_show_cgi_exec`. I'm not going to lie, I struggled to get this module to work properly. So in the end, I took a work around and used some LFI to grab the root flag. Navigating to the tunneled link `http://localhost:10000/file/show.cgi/root/root.txt` on my local machine gave me the root flag.
