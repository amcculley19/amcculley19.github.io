# TryHackMe - Gotta Catch'em All!
_________________________

This is a writeup of the Gotta Catch'em All! room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). TryHackMe has been the single greatest resource for a n00b like me to gain some hacking skills over the past seven months or so. Not only are the walkthroughs super helpful, but the cost is very reasonable and features just keep coming. If you're interested in cybersecurity, give it a look. I'm going to be honest here, the real reason I'm doing this room is for nostalgia's sake. I loved pokemon as a kid so I'm pretty excited to see what this box has in store.


## nmap Scan  

As always, I'm going to start the box by organizing my directories. I'll name the main directory `pokemon` and place an `nmap` directory inside of it to hold all the scans.
<br>
<br>

```
nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/pokemon_initial.txt 10.10.38.223

## Web Enumeration  

Looks like there's two ports open, 22 and 80 running `ssh` and `http` respectively. The website greets us with the default Apache 2 welcome screen. Running gobuster gives us nothing of importance, but looking at the source code gives us some interesting things.

We get a script tag with random pokemon, in addition to that it tells us to check the console and gives us an array of those random pokemon when we get there. There are also some html tags toward the bottom of the home page that look suspicious so I'll try logging in via ssh with the tags as creds.

## Foothold and User Flags  

It worked! Moving into the `Desktop` directory reveals a zip file. Unzipping the file gives us a directory and inside there is a file named `grass-type.txt`. Looking at the file, it appears to be in hex. Plugging that into [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) gives us the answer.

<br>

Poking around a little bit more I found a directory in `/etc` called `why_am_i_here ?`. The directory contained a file called `fire-type.txt`. The text is encoded in what appears to be base64 so if we run the command `cat fire-type.txt | base64 -d` we can get the decoded flag.

We get a hint from the room on question 2. It tells us to check the website. The website files are probably held in `/var/www/html`. Navigating there we see a file called `water-type.txt`. This string appears to be some kind of rotation cipher. Using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), I decoded the rotation cipher and got the flag.

## Root

Looking around the system in the `pokemon` user's home directory I stumbled on an interesting path in the `Videos` directory. At the end of that trail was a file that looked like it gave creds for another user.

This led me to the final flag, which was in a file called `roots-pokemon.txt`

## Final Thoughts

Quick room. Honestly, the box was a little messy, but still a fun way to kill a an hour or two. For beginners this is a good way to dip your toes into encryption and navigation of the linux file system as well as some other basic commands. Thanks for reading if you've gotten this far!
