# About

I like computers. Specifically, I like cybersecurity, linux, and networking. While most posts are going to be ctf writeups, I'm also planning on posting on whatever certification that I'm going after on the way to the OSCP. First up, CompTIA A+.


I'm on social media, but I'm a big advocate for leaving behind the traditional sites like twitter, facebook and instagram for more decentralized approaches so I'll be most active there.
