# About

This website is to keep track of my progress preparing for the OSCP. Right now I only work part-time teaching kids how to program, but I'm hoping to move into offensive security in the near future. I'm active on Hack the Box as well as Try Hack Me, and I'll be posting about whatever it is I'm studying for the week as well.

Stay tuned for updates!
